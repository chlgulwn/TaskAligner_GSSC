      "2. Refine the insurance premium pricing model based on traffic segments.  \n",
      "3. Develop risk scenarios based on recent fintech issues.  \n",

      "Team members' opinions:  \n",
      "- Data collection is mostly complete, but there are issues with SLA violations and missing data in smaller APIs.  \n",
      "- The classification of APIs into 'major' and 'minor' based on call volume and failure rates is a good approach, though more statistical validation is needed.  \n",
      "- The insurance premium model needs adjustments, particularly for real-time APIs where prediction errors are larger.  \n",
      "- Risk scenarios are being developed, but there is a need to incorporate more recent fintech-related issues.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mentor feedback:  \n",
      "- Previous scenarios were deemed too general; the team is encouraged to include specific recent incidents, such as authentication API failures leading to payment errors.\n"
